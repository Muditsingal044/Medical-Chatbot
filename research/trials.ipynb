    "#     page_content=\"College students often face long waiting times at health centers due to limited staff and resources, which can be improved by hiring more healthcare workers and introducing an appointment booking system. Preventive care is another major concern, as many illnesses could be avoided with regular check-ups, vaccinations, and early screening programs offered directly on campus. Dental health is often neglected because facilities are either unavailable or too expensive, making partnerships with local clinics for affordable or free dental check-ups essential. Academic pressure also poses a serious health risk, increasing stress and burnout among students, so time-management workshops and relaxation activities should be encouraged. Access to clean drinking water remains a basic yet crucial need, and installing more filtered water stations across campus can address this issue. For students with disabilities, proper infrastructure such as ramps, wheelchairs, and accessible restrooms is vital to ensure equal access to healthcare. Consistent health record keeping helps avoid delays in treatment, so a secure, centralized system should be implemented. Poor lifestyle habits like unhealthy eating and lack of exercise lower immunity, which can be tackled through nutrition workshops and healthy cooking classes. The overconsumption of energy drinks and junk food is another growing problem, and colleges can promote healthier options while limiting harmful ones. Basic first aid and CPR training should be provided so students are prepared to handle emergencies. Seasonal illnesses such as flu and allergies spread rapidly in college settings, and awareness drives with free check-ups during high-risk seasons can help prevent outbreaks. Mental health hotlines available 24/7 offer vital support for students in distress, especially outside clinic hours. Overcrowded dormitories contribute to poor hygiene and illness transmission, making better ventilation and sanitation a priority. Prolonged screen time from studies leads to eye strain, which can be reduced through regular eye check-ups and promoting screen breaks. Finally, having an on-campus pharmacy ensures students can quickly access common medicines and health supplies without leaving the campus.\",\n",
